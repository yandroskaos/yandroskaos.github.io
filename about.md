I’m passionate about computer technology. I like to understand how things work and
that lead me to the inner core of things, from disassembling code to advanced data
structures. I also consider myself a very motivated person and one who likes learning
new things everyday.

## Education

* PhD Student (stopped) - Working on compiler backend optimisation technology - University of Oviedo
* Master in Software Engineering (Computer systems and services for theInternet) — Polytechnic School of Engineering, University of Oviedo
* Computer Scientist — Polytechnic School of Engineering, University of Oviedo

## Others
* Developed a fully functional tiny operating system for PC over x86 architectures. I called it XkyOS. It is based on exokernel ideas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exokernel). Was developed from scratch and includes designing a file system, a binary module model (based on PE and ELF, which made tweak a bit visual studio compiler to produce invalid PE’s which were further processed to generate XkyOS modules) among other interesting things. Hardware supported includes SVGA, PS2 console (both keyboard and mouse), hard disk in PIO mode as well as common chipset elements (RTC). Can be found at https://github.com/yandroskaos/XkyOS
* Developed a full compiler targeting .NET IL for a full object oriented language.
* Interest in retrocomputing. Currently developing an emulator for iOS of an Amstrad CPC as hobby (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC).
