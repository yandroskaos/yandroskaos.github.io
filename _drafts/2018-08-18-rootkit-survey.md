description: Rootkit survey

Computer security is an old problem, as old as computers themselves.  
The evolution of computer threats has also experienced an exponential complexity development, being
the last example of that evolution the malware categorized as rootkits or stealth malware.  
A rootkit is code that is used by an attacker to keep the legitimate users and administrators of a system unaware of the code, and thus the attackerâ€™s presence on the compromised system.  
This paper will discuss the history of rootkits from the basic modification of system binaries to the cutting edge research being develop today.  
A discussion of each type of rootkit will be followed by an overview of rootkit detection techniques and how to know when a rootkit has been deployed.  
Finally new techniques and research directions will be discussed.
