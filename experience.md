## [Core Data](https://coredata.eu/) (2018 – Current)
Designing and developing a cryptocurrencies exchange market.

## [ByteHeed](https://www.byteheed.com/) (2015 – 2018)
Developer of a hypervisor-based protection engine.  
The hypervisor runs on IA-32, and takes advantage of its interception capabilities to provide a secure environment.  

## [University of Oviedo](http://www.atc.uniovi.es/) (2016 – 2017)
As Associate Professor, i taught Programming Foundations, Computer Forensics and Computer Architecture.

## [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (2013 – 2015)
Lead developer of anti-exploit protection engine.  
My responsibilities included general product development as well as adding new detection techniques.  
Reversing and finding clever solutions to protect running processes was everyday task.

## [Innovalia Metrology](https://www.innovalia-metrology.com/en/) (2011 – 2013)
Architect and lead developer of a cloud distributed metrology system known as M3, which allows to scan and acquire pieces, perform geometric and tolerance measurements, and access this information from a variety of devices.  
The system must perform well under heavy load as the data involved (point clouds) is quite large (a medium sized cloud contains 6M points on average, giving an estimated size of over two hundred megabytes).  
Also the application must be very optimized as certain processes over 3D data are very time, cpu and memory consuming.  
This leads to smart election of exotic data structures such as kd-trees, octrees, sparse heap arrays, etc.

## [Ideateca](http://ideateca.com/) ([Ludei](https://ludei.com/)) (2009 – 2011)
Lead developer and CTO. Ideateca is a small spanish startup initially focused on game development.  
Right now it has a spin-off named Ludei which continues developing game technology.  
At the time, i was responsible of the design and implementation of a multiplayer java-based system, which allowed to play from different devices, namely web, android and iPhone mobiles.  
This development evolved to the current Ludei’s multiplatform for mobiles technology.  
Another relevant event was that i developed “iBasket”, a very simple iPhone game which hit the apple store achieving 15M of downloads.

## [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.com/) (2008 – 2009)
As application maintenance engineer, I was part of the CRM team.  
I focused particularly in analyzing memory dumps from processes of the system to fix them.  
The system was made principally (among other elements) in different unix processes, and a Tuxedo middleware to connect to a Clarify front-end.

## [Panda Security](https://www.pandasecurity.com/) – (2005 – 2008)
I researched and developed different innovative technologies at Panda:
* Research and development of memory signatures to evade the problem related to exepackers (same malware packed lots of times, so disk signatures increase exponentially). Also what got called “heuristic signatures” which was used to identify unknown malware and classify it to its family.
* I maintained and extended Panda’s proactive solution. I developed a driver to allow the proactive technologies to control access to USB devices.
* Developed a driver which allowed to monitor in a proactive way rootkit behaviour in kernel. At the time it defeated SDT patches (by large the most common technique) and process hiding via manipulation of the process list.
* Design and implementation of Panda NanoScan (a light-weight, plugin oriented architected, very fast, web based scanner). At the time, restrictions were 20 seconds and 500KB to scan all memory, certain disk locations and ask Panda’s servers for hashes.
* Architect (with others) and developer of the kernel of the (at the time) new breed of Panda products.
